A Short Bio
====
Hello, there! My name is Tongnian Wang. I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Information Systems and Cyber Security at the University of Texas at San Antonio. 

I conduct multidisciplinary research at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), data science, and healthcare information systems, where I develop responsible and trustworthy AI solutions that enhance clinical decision-making, strengthen healthcare delivery, and improve patient outcomes. My work leverages cutting-edge technologies such as large language models (LLMs), deep learning, machine learning, and natural language processing. Ultimately, my goal is to ensure AI innovations translate into better care and healthier lives.
